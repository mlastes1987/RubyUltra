# Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire Ultra

Based on the [**pokeruby**](https://github.com/pret/pokeruby) disassembly from pret.

# Features Implemented

- **Special Features Twins:** in front of the southmost house in Petalburg City you can find 2 girls that from left to right give you 99 Rare Candies and then 99 Master Balls respectively.  This is a great feature for more casual players.

- **Trade Evolutions:** Kadabra, Graveler, Machoke and Haunter evolve at level 37.

- **Item Holding Trade Evolutions:** Any mon that evolves while being traded holding an item (i.e. Poliwhirl holding King's Rock for Politoed) can now evolve by using the items from the bag.

- **Changed Starters:** The starters have been changed to Treecko, Cyndaquil, and Squirtle.  Their movesets have also seen some changes.

- **Moveset Changes:** Other mons, such as the trade evolutions have changes and others will see changes throughout the progress of the design of this mod.

- **Startup Money:** Instead of 3,000 you now start with 35,000 Pokedollars much like Gen 7.

- **Startup PC Items:** You now in addition to a Potion, start with 99 PP UPs.

Coming soon...
